# Jammerware's Paladin Class
A mod for XCOM2 that adds a new class for fun, profit, and the righteous union of swords and explosions. Not for the faint of heart or for people who appreciate well-reasoned game design.

## Design
The goal of the paladin class is to encourage the pattern of combining multiple types of attacks in a single turn and to make the player feel awesome when they do.

### Allowed Weapons
**Primary**: Holy Blade

**Secondary**: Psi-amp

**Squaddie**

*Holy Strike* - Attack any enemy within range of a single move with your holy blade. Holy Strike doesn't end your turn.

| Rank | Firebrand | Crusader |
| ---- | --------- | -------- |
| **Corporal** |  *Greatheart* - Allies who start their turn adjacent to you gain 2 mobility on their first move of the turn. | *Charge* - Holy Strike gains 2 range. |
| **Sergeant** | *Growing Fervor* - Using a psi ability increases the damage of your next Holy Strike by 2. | *Smite* - When you hit enemy with Holy Strike, the cooldown of Soulfire is reduced by one turn. |
| **Lieutenant** | *Meditation* - If you end your turn without using a psi ability, the remaining cooldown of all of your psi abilities is reduced by 2. | *Sear* - Enemies you damage with Soulfire deal reduced damage to you. Lasts 2 turns. |
| **Captain** | *Vestimentum Ignis* - When you take damage, the attacker has a 50% chance to be afflicted with *Burning*.  | *Vestimentum Lux* - When an enemy within 5 tiles of you takes damage, gain 5 Defense until your next turn. |
| **Major** | *Psifury* - Using a psi ability doesn't end your turn. You can use only 1 psi ability each turn. | *Revelation* - Deal psi damage to a target. If you damaged an enemy with Holy Strike this turn, *Revelation* damages a second target nearby and stuns both for 1 turn. |
| **Colonel** | *Dawn* - Afflict enemies in an area with *Light*. The first successful Holy Strike or direct psi attack on a target with *Light* refunds 1 action point. | *Crusade* - Afflict all enemies within 5 tiles of you with *Judged*. Enemies with *Judged* take 5 psi damage when they attack or are attacked. This consumes *Judged*. |
